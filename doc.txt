Setting up Denigma
==================

In order to set up Denigma locally just do the following.

1. Git in:
Go to the GIT bootcamp: https://github.com/

2. Fork Denigma:
git clone https://github.com/hevok/denigma

3. Start Denigma:
cd denigma
denigma/manage.py syncdb
denigma/manage.py runserver

4. Change Denigma:
git commit -am "Brief description of the change."
git push origin master


Deploying Denigma
=================

To deploy Denigma in the Clouds the Amazone Web Service (AWS) is used.

1. Launch an Ubuntu AMI:
Preferable a maverick build such as the ami-975a6de3 (called Giter; which ships a GIT repository) or the ami-fd7b4089 (called Daily which is up-to-date and does not require updating/upgrading).
Set up of Giter takes approximately 7 minutes and the Daily takes 3 minutes due to the already installed updates.

2. ssh into the machine with the DNS and keypairs aquired from the Amazone Control Center (use bash ami.sh). On the machine:
sudo su
cd ..
aptitude install git # Only on Daily, not necessary on Giter. 
git clone http://github.com/hevok/denigma
bash denigma/configure.sh
