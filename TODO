Denigma Enhancement Proposal Protocol
=====================================

DEPs
====

This are Denigma Enhancement Proposals (DEPs):

- Need to get GIT from Denigma server working.
- restore.sh for restoring a snapshotted database.
- Automate EC2 instance setup [http://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/ec2-userdata].
- Use Fabric for ssh control of Denigma [http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.4.3/index.html].


Data app
--------

The blog, news, wiki, tutorial app and several other follow the same pattern:
Each one contains an data entry which has a title, a text and tags associated.
tags itself can be data entry or linked to be a data entry. There are further 
meta data associated with each entry such as date of creation (created), 
update (updated).

Another field might declare whether it is drafted or not.
Each entry content (text) needs to be rendered in html and have automatically 
assigned hyperlinks and should allow to use markup languages. Further images 
need to be associated to a entry.

It is therefore proposed to have a single data app which eliminates the redundance 
between all this different apps. Either tags or another table maybe it can be called 
type or category declares what type of entry it is.
