        <p>Denigma is unique as everything in it is fully editable as well as programmible.
        Denigma can in priniciple be changes in two fashions:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Content: regarding the actually content its composed of.</li>
        <li>Design: how it is conceptional build.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As soon as your Email address is verivied you gain staff status and be able to access the admin interface and get access the tables in Denigma db.</p>
        <p>Data in Denigma is organized according to application (apps). There are for instance annotations, datasets, expressions and lifespan apps.</p>

        <p><a href="/admin/annotations"><b>Annotations</b></a> integrates information majorly from external sources such as gene annotation databases.</p>

        <p><a href="/admin/datasets"><b>Datasets</b></a> is a collection of diverse data (e.g. from individual studies) where each table represents a single dataset.</p>

        <p><a href="/admin/expressions"><b>Expressions</b></a> contains transcriptomics or proteomics profiles of gene activity measurements.</p>

        <p><a href="/admin/lifespan"><b>Lifespan</b></a> is most important constitute of Denigma which is dedicated to systematically decipher the aging process and reveal the limits of life. In the lifespan section the probaly most import model are describing the factors with limit lifespan.</p>
        <p>Functionality to Denigma can be easily added by exting and existing app or just adding a new app.
        A todo can be converted into a DEP (Denigma Enhancement Proposal). This should preferbly written in restructured text.</p>
