<h4>>>> import this</h4>
<p>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters</p>
<li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
<li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
<li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
<li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
<li>Flat is better than nester.</li>
<li>Sparse is better than dense.</li>
<li>Readibility counts.</li>
<li>Special cases arn't special enough to break the rules.</li>
<li>Although practicality beats purity.</li>
<li>Errors should never pass silently.</li>
<li>Unless should explicitly silenced.</li>
<li>In the face of amibiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</li>
<li>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</li>
<li>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</li>
<li>Now is better than never.</li>
<li>Although never is often better than *right* now.</li>
<li>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</li>
<li>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</li>
<li>Namespace are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</li>
